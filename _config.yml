 Hi! I hope you are well. Iâ€™m Sofi, a veterinarian and university assistant professor who became a Data Analyst. 
  <br><br>
  I find my experience as a veterinarian, assistant professor and researcher to be an advantage when it comes to thinking logically, analyzing big data and solving problems judiciously. My main interest is to continue training as a Machine Learning Specialist.
